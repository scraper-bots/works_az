### What This Shows
The majority of candidates expect salaries in the 1,001-2,000 AZN range, with a significant portion willing to work for 501-1,000 AZN. High-salary expectations (2,001-5,000 AZN) represent a smaller segment.

### Business Impact
- **Budget Planning:** Most candidates align with mid-range compensation budgets
- **Cost Optimization:** Large talent pool available at 1,001-2,000 AZN range reduces salary pressure
